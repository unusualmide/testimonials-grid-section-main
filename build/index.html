            <h2 class="text-lg font-bold leading-5 pt-2 pb-5 text-white">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel i got every penny's worth.</h2>
            <p class="text-[11px] text-white/70">" I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it increadibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR Startup. "</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold leading-5 pt-3 pb-5">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
        <p class="text-[11px] text-black/70">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!  "</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold leading-5 pt-2 pb-5 text-white">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</h2>
        <p class="text-[11px] text-white/70">" The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. "</p>
